**Project Description**
### The idea behind this project
Nowadays we are rashly moving into the digital world we have already entered but still, only a few percent of this population are able to use it.

So, for payment, we used to scan the phone pay scanner and do our payment. This is not only limited to the payment. We have a wide area for this available around us like any product info we get enclosed in the QR-code. For reading this, we need to have a decoder-like application should be available to us. That is the qr-code reader.
### How does it work

while loading the project we will have an upload button to update any QR image to get your result.
